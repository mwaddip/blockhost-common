# CLAUDE.md

## Rules

- After every code change and before pushing to GitHub, review and update documentation (README.md and DESIGN.md) if the changes affect any documented APIs, directory structures, usage examples, or architecture. Skip documentation updates only when the change has zero impact on anything documented.
